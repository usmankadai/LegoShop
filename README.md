### API and Documentation

### Key Features and Functionalilty:




### Reasons for a specific paradigm

| Paradigm used | Reasons for a specific paradigm |
|----| ----|
|Auth0| Auth0 provides functionality to ensure authorization and authentication using a passwordless login. The benefit of Auth0 is developer won't be worried about having to store user credentials in the database. Thus making the application more secured from attackers.|
|Multiple-page Application| Choosing between Single page and Multiple page in this coursework, i took some pros and cons into consideration. I started the intial development using a SPA because it is fast and are loaded once. SPA caches any local storage pretty well but, it is very tricky to manipulate the URLs and it's becomes slow especially when we have a lot of content on a page. I had issues with the history API. I swtiched my application to a multiple page as the URLs manipulation is easy even though SPA creates a better user experince. Also, it allows new pages for each lego and implementing any change to a specific page. if a JS file should fail not the whole app throws an error or crashes. |

### Future Development

* Due to the lack of time, some features i desired to achieve were not implemented. If there was time i would have implemented search for inventories using array.filter to create a new array of inventories that matches the input.value of being entered.
